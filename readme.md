## How to run the tests

1. Download testbox from: http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/testbox
2. Unzip the testbox/ folder into the root of the application (as a peer to tests)
3. The tests expect a redis instance to be running on localhost:6379, edit the top of /tests/basicTest.cfc if your instance is different
3. run /tests/index.cfm - will run the individual tests under basic remotely to be able to set the cookie headers

Or, if you use docker / docker-compose, you can use the included docker-compose file.

1. Clone the project.
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Hit the docker ip address on port 80.

You could swap out the `app` service with lucee or other coldfusion version if you would rather use that.
